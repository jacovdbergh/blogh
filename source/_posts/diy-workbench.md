My [3D printed Land Rover project](/blog/landy-posts/) has hit a roadblock; I need to reprint the gearbox in something stronger and more suited for high temperatures.

But I haven't gotten round to sourcing that, so my hobby/electronics table in my home office has been in the below state for about a month.

So instead of getting the right filament and finishing the project, I decided it would be a good time to build a proper electronic workbench.
To be fair, I got the idea from [a Geekpub video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KfWMJV7fQ0&ab_channel=TheGeekPub) and I convinced myself I needed a proper workbench to continue any type of work on the Landy. I purchased [the plans](https://www.thegeekpub.com/272268/build-the-ultimate-electronics-workbench/), and then started to look around for materials locally. I had to adjust the size of the workbench to fit in the space I had available,
and updated the cutting list accordingly.

I used the following:
 - Various sizes pine wood for the frame from Chamberlains
 - 20mm thick Shutterply for the top from [Chamberlains](https://www.chamberlains.co.za/18-20mm-oiled-shutterply-pine-board-1220x2440mm-1024260)
 - BW Grey and Midnight Blue Color-Cote from [Chamberlains](https://www.chamberlains.co.za/timberlife-color-cote-burgandy-1l-1071476)
 - Adjustable feet from [Gelmar](https://www.gelmar.co.za/leveling-foot-76mm-m10-x-25mm.html)

 I also purchased a shiny new mitre saw, a Metabo KGS 254

I got Chamberlains to cut the shutterply into the required board sizes for the top, and the rest of the cuts were where the Metabo came in.

I couldn't assemble the workbench outside, as it would not fit through the door in one piece. So we carried the pieces into the house, to paint and put together.

For lighting I mounted a PioLed T8 light under the bottom shelf.

 So much more room for activities now.

 Now just waiting for my [laboratory stool from Karo](https://shop.karo.co.za/products/round-polyurethane-stool?variant=39315868090465), and a [project mat from Takealot](https://www.takealot.com/hamble-a2-self-healing-double-sided-rotary-cutting-mat-for-diy-c/PLID71233137).
