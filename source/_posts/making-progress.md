I've now printed about 11 of the required 29 build plates full of parts. The photos speak for themselves, so I won't waste your time with too much text this time round.

I went back to my now favorite hobby shop, and picked up 4 tyres and a Fly Sky FS-GT2B transmitter and receiver.

Very happy with the tyres, as they have the same look as the BFGoodrich's I have on my lifesize Landy, but for a very reasonable price.

I'm now waiting on the first prints for the gearbox to finish. Using eSun PLA+ for the gears, and hoping it will be strong enough, as well as not melt from the heat of the motor.
