## Introduction

I've had my Creality Ender 3 Pro for ~2.5 years now, and have printed a range of useful and interesting things. But I've not yet printed something **big** with it. Other people print helmets or swords from games and other fantasy worlds, but those have never resonated with me.

And then I stumbled upon this: [Model 5: Landy 4x4 Wagon](https://www.3dsets.com/product/model-5-landy-4x4-wagon/)

And that struck a chord.

See, I own a 2001 Land Rover Defender TD5. It's our holiday vehicle, and it's given us many kilometers of joy and taken us to places most other cars wouldn't.

So when I saw the model RC one, I just knew I had to build one. I told the wife our almost 2 year old son will love it, but in reality it's going to be a couple of years before he can appreciate and play with it. Which means by then I'd have built him his own one ðŸ˜‰.

## Sourcing parts

This is still an ongoing task, as it's not that easy to find everything you need for the model in South Africa. And shipping costs from Aliexpress/Amazon is too high to just conveniently order it all.

So this section will still be expanded as I manage to find all the parts I need.

### Filament
*Funkiments*

### Bearings

28 x 6700ZZ bearings.

A local bearing shop charges R75 (~\$6) ea., which works out to R2100 (\$150) just for the bearings. That's half the price of a [Tamiya kit](https://jixhobbies.co.za/collections/r-c-crawler-trucks/products/tam58657) that includes almost everything you need to build an RC Landy...

So I bought just one bearing from them, to do calibration with, and will try and find the rest somewhere else.

Third time's the charm, and looks like I have to print all the parts at 100,5% scale for a snug fit.
