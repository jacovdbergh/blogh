## Introduction

I've had my Creality Ender 3 Pro for ~2.5 years now, and have printed a range of useful and interesting things. But I've not yet printed something **big** with it. Other people print helmets or swords from games and other fantasy worlds, but those have never resonated with me.

And then I stumbled upon this: [Model 5: Landy 4x4 Wagon](https://www.3dsets.com/product/model-5-landy-4x4-wagon/)

And that struck a chord.

See, I own a 2001 Land Rover Defender TD5. It's our holiday vehicle, and it's given us many kilometers of joy and taken us to places most other cars wouldn't.

So when I saw the model RC one, I just knew I had to build one. I told the wife our almost 2 year old son will love it, but in reality it's going to be a couple of years before he can appreciate and play with it. Which means by then I'd have built him his own one ðŸ˜‰.

A short list of its most exciting features:
```
- XXL size â€“ 54 cm long!
- redesigned gearbox with more durable gears
- realistic body details, embossed into the part surface
- detailed interior
```

## Sourcing parts

This is still an ongoing task, as it's not that easy to find everything you need for the model in South Africa. And shipping costs from Aliexpress/Amazon is too high to just conveniently order it all.

So this section will still be expanded as I manage to find all the parts I need.

### Filament
The build guide states you need ~3kg of PLA to print this model; 2kg for the chassis and gearbox/drivetrain, and 1kg for the body.

I've had great success with eSun's PLA+ filament in the past, it just prints without any issues.

But locally, the shop that supplies it is located in Durban. And it just so happens that [Durban was not a very good place to be](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-57822460) at the time I wanted to order.

So I started looking around for other options, and found a highly recommended locally manufactured filament: [Funkiments](https://www.funkiments.co.za/). They unfortunately do not have a green I'd like for the body, but I ordered 2kg of black and 1kg of white PLA.

One snag, their Funkiments filament does not come on a spool. You need to either order 2 hardboard sides and print a core, or [print a whole spool](https://www.funkiments.co.za/2020/11/12/how-to-use-our-printed-filament-spool/).

The hardboard sides were sold out, so I had to print the whole thing, which took more than 24 hours in printing time in total.

But I now have a spool, and could continue with printing the calibration part, which is Print 0 in the list of 39 prints for the model.

### Bearings

28 x 6700ZZ bearings.

I went to a local bearing shop, and they charge R75 (~\$6) for one bearing, which works out to R2100 (\$150) in total. That's half the price of a [Tamiya kit](https://jixhobbies.co.za/collections/r-c-crawler-trucks/products/tam58657) that includes almost everything you need to build an RC Landy...

So I bought just one bearing from them, to do calibration with, and will try and find the rest somewhere else.

I printed Print 0, the calibration block, on 100% scale, which was too tight. Then on 101% which was too loose. So then tried 100,5%, which resulted in a fit which was just right.

Third time's the charm, and looks like I have to print all the parts at 100,5% scale for a snug fit.
