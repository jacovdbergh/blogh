## TODO

I have wanted to start a blog/personal site for a long time now, mostly for myself, to keep track of the things I'm doing.

Now that I've finally gotten round to getting a site online, I've got years of backlog content to write up.

So here's a list of things I want to maybe write about when I have the time. If there's any request for a specific one of them, I might get round to it a bit quicker. [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jacovdbergh) if anything tickles your fancy.

- My Home Assistant setup / My smart home
- DIY solar installation with a hybrid inverter, backup circuit and battery
- Building smart openers for my garage and gate that integrates with Home Assistant
- Designing and building a carport
- 3D printing and assembling a [3DSets Landy](https://www.3dsets.com/product/model-5-landy-4x4-wagon/)
- Making my pool pump smarter
- Integrating irrigation with Home Assistant
- Designing and building a fridge drawer system for a Defender 110
- Building a 3-phase power logger with SigFox reporting
- A smarter geyser, or one that can run from my solar installation at least
